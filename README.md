# Robocorner
A simple online store page for an imaginary business, made as an assigment. The business chosen is a futuristic store for robot servants with a wide variety of uses, as well as some accesories.

# Front end
The front end consists of:
1. Homepage that displays a random banner from a selection of promotional campaigns and a random selection of products on sale.
2. Product list, products shown and described through a card matrix.
3. Contact page.
4. Shopping cart, asks for delivery info and allows for elimination of products, then permits the "payment" of the cart's content.

It is impossible to order more of a product than the recorded inventory, which is also automatically deducted once a purchase is finalized.

Product images were created through Copilot Designer.

# Back end
The back end is initialized by a login page. Allows the management of employees, products, and promo banners, as well as reviewing paid sales.
